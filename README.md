# bus-tracker
Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker
Description of the project: This project currently displays the bus route near MiT with a marker moving to each stop along the route.
How to Run: To run this on your machine, you can simply drag the link to your web browser and click on the button to move the marker to each of its stops.
Roadmap of future improvements: In the future I would like to add more functionality or possibly more data points so that more routes can be included and displayed.
License information: This project was created with MITx Pro women's cohort and is under their licensing.
